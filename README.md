# Pytorch_icnn
## Introduction
This project is a general Interlinked Convolutional Neural Networks model implemented by Pytorch.
The main idea come from this paper, [Interlinked Convolutional Neural Networks forFace Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.02479.pdf)
## Feature
We redesign the model in two parts:iCNN_node and iCNN_cell,
You can use iCNN_cell to design your own interlinked layers and use them in your own models.
